this repository contains decompiled source code of "telegram talaei". this app is an unofficial telegram client developed in iran. 
I found some privacy violation in this app and published this code for other security researchers to verify my claims.  
you can find my article about this app in https://virgool.io/InfoSec/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%A7-%DA%A9%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-jpvsc7dtthyq (in persian)

important note: I have no relation with developers of this app and I do not own this code (I decompiled it) and probably you cant compile this code but if you did it do not install it.
